\begin{document}
\maketitle

Please use this structure for your report. Your report should be no more than 20 pages, including figures, but excluding bibliography and academic honesty. Do not include \emph{any} code or code output in your report. Indicate your informal collaborators (outside your group) on the assignment, if you had any.

\section{Introduction}

\section{EDA}

\section{Feature selection and engineering}

\section{Data splitting}

\section{Modeling}

\section{Bibliography}
Include any references you used in your report here.
\appendix
\section{Academic honesty}
Note that this section (and the bibliography) don't count towards the page limit (I realized having academic honesty count towards the page limit creates some bad incentives\ldots).
\subsection{Statement}
Please include a joint academic honesty statement here. Do NOT include any of your names.
\subsection{Collaborators}
List any collaborators outside your group here.
\subsection{LLM Usage}
If, in accordance with the policy in \texttt{lab4-instructions.pdf}, you used LLMs when completing this lab, please see the instructions for what to write here.
